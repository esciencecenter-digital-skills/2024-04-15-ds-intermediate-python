## 🏢 Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'MatrixONE' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

## 🎓 Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl.
Please request your certificate within 8 months after the workshop, as we will delete all personal identifyable information after this period.

## 🧠 Collaborative Notes
- If you don't update/maintain your software it will be outdated from day 1 because the other software you built upon is developing continuously
- For Windows users: if `pip freeze > requirements.txt` gives an `stdout is not a tty` error, replace it with:
  - `pip freeze`
  - copy the output
  - paste it into a `requirements.txt` file yourself.

- [Blog post on not using too much CI computation]
