## 🏢 Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'MatrixONE' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

## 🎓 Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl.
Please request your certificate within 8 months after the workshop, as we will delete all personal identifyable information after this period.

**Section 5**

If you do not have an "Issues" feature in your forked repository, you can enable them as follows. On github, go to your forked repository, and then to the "Settings" tab. Then activate the checkmark on "Issues":

## 🧠 Collaborative Notes

- If you don't want your conda base environment to be activated by default in your terminal, you can use `conda config --set auto_activate_base false`. See also [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54560785/1044698)

- Question: when working with HPC systems, you often have, apart from your actual central code repository, slurm scripts, configuration files, etc. that you use to run a certain workflow. These are system dependent (the might work for Snellius and not for the University cluster) and don't really fit with the central model code repository. Where should I keep track of these? 
    - In general it is useful, if the central repository code is meant to be run on HPC systems, to have installation and/or usage instructions for some common clusters that it is being used on. For example the eWatercycle project documentation discusses [configuration on Snellius](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system_setup.html#configuration-file-for-snellius-system).
    - For specific scripts that invoke the central package for personal usecases, you could make a github repository in your personal account.
