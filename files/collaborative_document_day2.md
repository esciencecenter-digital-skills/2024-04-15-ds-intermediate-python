## 🏢 Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'MatrixONE' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

## 🎓 Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl.
Please request your certificate within 8 months after the workshop, as we will delete all personal identifyable information after this period.

## 🧠 Collaborative Notes

- To get a nice graphical overview of your commit history, you can use the following options:
  - In the terminal: `git log --oneline --graph --all`
    - If you enjoy this, you can also set it to run under e.g. `git lg` with:<br>`git config --global alias.lg 'log --oneline --graph --all'`
  - In VS Code: [Git Graph Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)
  - In PyCharm: Open the 'Git' or 'Version Control' tab, which you can usually find at the bottom left of your editor, or under 'View -> Tool Windows'




### Items to correct in the course materials
Poetry: the `--dev` option is deprecated, use the `--group dev` notation instead.

## :bulb: Tip&top :thumbsup: 

### Top (what did you really like about today?)

- Lots of info about architechtures and paradigms in a condensed way, nice
- Very interesting content
- Really nice content, I liked the mix between versioning and coding paradigms and playing around with the different implementations was cool
- As others, the condensed information on software engineering/architecture and paradigms is really helpful.
- Nice wake-up song

### Tip (what would you like us to improve?)

- Perhaps having a "secret" complete, fully formed repo with exercises so people can pull it if lagged behind 
- It would be nice if all the lunch sandwiches are like the few nice ones that are in the smaller box now, so everyone can have a good sandwich :)
- There appear to be some mistakes with branch names in the tutorial. 
- It's not very clear how we can change everything and re-submit after the code review with the pull request. 
- A sort of heads-up about where we needed to sync with out group mates to start section 4 ahead of time would be nice, since now some people needed to rush a bit and it might be detrimental to information retention
